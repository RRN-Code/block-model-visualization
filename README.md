# 🧱 Block Model Visualization (3D Web App)

This project is a web-based interactive 3D visualization of a simple block model using [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/). It simulates a geological block model where each block represents a volume of material with attributes like rock type, ore flag, and metal grades.
